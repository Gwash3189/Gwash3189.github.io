My names Adam. I'm a Developer [@Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/jobs/) from Melbourn, Aus. I have been programming for fun and professionally since 2011. I started with C and Java, but quickly moved into web development with PHP and JavaScript. Now, I mostly live in the Frontend world. However, i do jump into the backend every now and then.

I dabble in other languages as i have a real passion for learning new things. The web is my favourite platform, i love that it never stops progressing.

All of the open source work is available on my [github](https://github.com/Gwash3189) account.

Most recently i've been spending my time with

 * React
 * Redux
 * Elixir
 * Ruby
 * Node.js
